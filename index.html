          <h2>about me</h2>
          <p class="first-paragraph">
            Ever since high school, I’ve been interested in IT and programming.
            That is the main reason why I was thrilled to go to Peter the Great
            St. Petersburg Polytechnic University to study Fundamental Computer
            Science and Information Technology.
          </p>
          <p class="second-paragraph">
            Studying at the university taught me a whole host of valuable
            skills, such as being collaborative, independent (which is more
            about time management and study-life-balance), active and
            persistent. In addition to the previously listed skills, I would
            like to highlight self-learning since this ability cannot be
            dispensed with both at the university and in real life.
          </p>
          <p class="third-paragraph">
            At present, I’m 20 years old and I’m a 3rd year student, learning
            web programming at the RS-School in parallel. In my opinion,
            Frontend Development is not only one of the most promising
            industries of the future, but it also provides sizeable
            opportunities for showing your creativity in elaborating effective
            solutions, as well as simplifying people’s lives by creating
            user-friendly websites and apps. I am certain that Web Development
            is the field in which I see myself and want to actively develop in
            the upcoming years.
