## About Me

Ever since high school, I've been interested in IT and programming. That is the main reason why I was
thrilled to go to Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University to study Fundamental Computer
Science and Information Technology.

Studying at the university taught me a whole host of valuable skills, such as being collaborative,
independent (which is more about time management and study-life-balance), active and persistent.
In addition to the previously listed skills, I would like to highlight self-learning since this ability cannot be dispensed with both at the university and in real life.

At present, I'm 20 years old and I'm a 3rd year student, learning web programming at the RS-School in
parallel. In my opinion, Frontend Development is not only one of the most promising industries of the
future, but it also provides sizeable opportunities for showing your creativity in elaborating effective
solutions, as well as simplifying people's lives by creating user-friendly websites and apps. I am certain that
Web Development is the field in which I see myself and want to actively develop in the upcoming years.
